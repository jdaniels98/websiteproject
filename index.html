                As the name suggests, Drakengard 3 is the third game in the Drakengard series, releasing in 2013 in
                Japan, and 2014 worldwide, and serves as a prequel to the original 2003 Drakengard. The same core team
                that worked on the previous Drakengard games worked on the game, with the return of Yoko Taro in a
                leading role for the title after his noted abscence of such a role in the development of Drakengard 2 in
                2005.

                The game follows Zero, a woman with a flower in her eye, and her childish dragon Mikhail, as they search
                to hunt down her five magical sisters the Intoners, who use the Power of Songs to rule the lands and
                subjucate humanity. THe game features ground-based hack-and-slash combat along with aerial combat
                similar to the Panzer Dragoon series. The game features multiple endings, different branching storylines, and a collection of DLC episodes where the player can control the five Intoner sisters they spend the main game hunting down, exploring what they were doing prior to the start of the main game.
